# pyramid_task_beginner
# Hey there, in school I have a task regarding a colored pyramid and I need some help. Thanks in advance.
# The task is simple. We have a pyramid, made out of 10 balls. Each ball has a number and a colour. Which means we can define a relation T which holds all balls that * 
# touch each other. I have now the task to write a function which takes two colours and checks, if there are any balls with the given colours that touch each other.
# I will post all needed files asap.
# Once again, very much thanks in advance. I dont know where the problem is..
